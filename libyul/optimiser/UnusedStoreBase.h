/**
 * Base class for both UnusedAssignEliminator and UnusedStoreEliminator.
 *
 * The class tracks the state of abstract "stores" (assignments or mstore/sstore
 * statements) across the control-flow. It is the job of the derived class to create
 * the stores and track references, but the base class manages control-flow splits and joins.
 *
 * In general, active stores are those where it has not yet been determined if they are used
 * or not. Those are split and joined at control-flow forks. Once a store has been deemed
 * used, it is removed from the active set and marked as used and this will never change.
 *
 * Prerequisite: Disambiguator, ForLoopInitRewriter.
