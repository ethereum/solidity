 * The following AST elements have a default cost of zero (because the cleanup phase would
 * remove them anyway or they are just wrappers around something else that will be counted instead):
 *  - expression statement (only the expression inside has a cost)
 *  - block (only the statements inside have a cost)
 *  - variable references
 *  - variable declarations (only the right hand side has a cost)
 *  - assignments (only the value has a cost)
 *  - literal zeros (we optimistically assume they can be copied from somewhere else)
 *
 * Each statement incurs and additional cost of one
 * per jump/branch. This means if, break and continue statements have a cost of 2,
 * switch statements have a cost of 1 plus the number of cases times two,
 * and for loops cost 3.
