/**
 * FunctionSpecializer: Optimiser step that specializes the function with its literal arguments.
 *
 * If a function, say, `function f(a, b) { sstore (a, b)}`, is called with literal arguments, for
 * example, `f(x, 5)`, where `x` is an identifier, it could be specialized by creating a new
 * function `f_1` that takes only one argument, i.e.,
 *
 *   function f_1(a_1) {
 *     let b_1 := 5
 *     sstore(a_1, b_1)
 *   }
 *
 * Other optimization steps will be able to make more simplifications to the function. The
 * optimization step is mainly useful for functions that would not be inlined.
 *
 * Prerequisites: Disambiguator, FunctionHoister
 *
 * LiteralRematerialiser is recommended as a prerequisite, even though it's not required for
 * correctness.
