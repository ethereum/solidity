/**
 * Optimiser component that removes assignments to variables that are not used
 * until they go out of scope or are re-assigned. This component
 * respects the control-flow and takes it into account for removal.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * {
 *   let a
 *   a := 1
 *   a := 2
 *   b := 2
 *   if calldataload(0)
 *   {
 *     b := mload(a)
 *   }
 *   a := b
 * }
 *
 * In the example, "a := 1" can be removed because the value from this assignment
 * is not used in any control-flow branch (it is replaced right away).
 * The assignment "a := 2" is also overwritten by "a := b" at the end,
 * but there is a control-flow path (through the condition body) which uses
 * the value from "a := 2" and thus, this assignment cannot be removed.
 *
 * Detailed rules:
 *
 * The AST is traversed twice: in an information gathering step and in the
 * actual removal step. During information gathering, assignment statements
 * can be marked as "potentially unused" or as "used".
 *
 * When an assignment is visited, it is stored in the "set of all stores" and
 * added to the branch-dependent "active" sets for the assigned variables. This active
 * set for a variable contains all statements where that variable was last assigned to, i.e.
 * where a read from that variable could read from.
 * Furthermore, all other active sets for the assigned variables are cleared.
 *
 * When a reference to a variable is visited, the active assignments to that variable
 * in the current branch are marked as "used". This mark is permanent.
 * Also, the active set for this variable in the current branch is cleared.
 *
 * At points where control-flow splits, we maintain a copy of the active set
 * (all other data structures are shared across branches).
 *
 * At control-flow joins, we combine the sets of active stores for each variable.
 *
 * In the example above, the active set right after the assignment "b := mload(a)" (but before
 * the control-flow join) is "b := mload(a)"; the assignment "b := 2" was removed.
 * After the control-flow join it will contain both "b := mload(a)" and "b := 2", coming from
 * the two branches.
 *
 * For for-loops, the condition, body and post-part are visited twice, taking
 * the joining control-flow at the condition into account.
 * In other words, we create three control flow paths: Zero runs of the loop,
 * one run and two runs and then combine them at the end.
 * Running at most twice is enough because this takes into account all possible control-flow connections.
 *
 * Since this algorithm has exponential runtime in the nesting depth of for loops,
 * a shortcut is taken at a certain nesting level: We only use the zero- and
 * once-run of the for loop and change any assignment that was newly introduced
 * in the for loop from to "used".
 *
 * For switch statements that have a "default"-case, there is no control-flow
 * part that skips the switch.
 *
 * At ``leave`` statements, all return variables are set to "used" and the set of active statements
 * is cleared.
 *
 * If a function or builtin is called that does not continue, the set of active statements is
 * cleared for all variables.
 *
 * In the second traversal, all assignments that are not marked as "used" are removed.
 *
 * This step is usually run right after the SSA transform to complete
 * the generation of the pseudo-SSA.
 *
 * Prerequisite: Disambiguator, ForLoopInitRewriter.
