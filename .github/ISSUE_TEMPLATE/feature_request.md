## Abstract

Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language
and reason about it.

## Motivation

In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier,
including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The
specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.

## Backwards Compatibility

All language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing
these incompatibilities and their severity.

Please describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.
