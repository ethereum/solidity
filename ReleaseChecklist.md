## Checklist for making a release:

### Requirements
 - [ ] GitHub account with access to [solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity), [solc-js](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js),
       [solc-bin](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin), [solidity-website](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-website).
 - [ ] DockerHub account with push rights to the [``solc`` image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereum/solc).
 - [ ] Launchpad (Ubuntu One) account with a membership in the ["Ethereum" team](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum) and
       a gnupg key for your email in the ``ethereum.org`` domain (has to be version 1, gpg2 won't work).
 - [ ] Ubuntu/Debian dependencies of the PPA scripts: ``devscripts``, ``debhelper``, ``dput``, ``git``, ``wget``, ``ca-certificates``.
 - [ ] [npm Registry](https://www.npmjs.com) account added as a collaborator for the [``solc`` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solc).
 - [ ] Access to the [solidity_lang Twitter account](https://twitter.com/solidity_lang).
 - [ ] [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) account that is at least 10 days old with a minimum of 20 comment karma (``/r/ethereum`` requirements).

### Pre-flight checks
At least a day before the release:
 - [ ] Run ``make linkcheck`` from within ``docs/`` and fix any broken links it finds.
       Ignore false positives caused by ``href`` anchors and dummy links not meant to work.
       **Note**: In order to run the link check, make sure you've built the docs first via ``docs.sh``.
 - [ ] Double-check that [the most recent docs builds at readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/solidity/builds/) succeeded.
 - [ ] Make sure that all merged PRs that should have changelog entries do have them.
 - [ ] Rerun CI on the top commits of main branches in all repositories that do not have daily activity by creating a test branch or PR:
      - [ ] ``solc-js``
      - [ ] ``solc-bin`` (make sure the bytecode comparison check did run)
 - [ ] (Optional) Create a prerelease in our Ubuntu PPA by following the steps in the PPA section below on ``develop`` rather than on a tag.
       This is recommended especially when dealing with PPA for the first time, when we add a new Ubuntu version or when the PPA scripts were modified in this release cycle.
 - [ ] Verify that the release tarball of ``solc-js`` works.
       Bump version locally, add ``soljson.js`` from CI, build it, compare the file structure with the previous version, install it locally and try to use it.
 - [ ] Review [Learning from Past Releases](https://notes.ethereum.org/@solidity/release-mistakes) to make sure you don't repeat the same mistakes.

### Drafts
At least a day before the release:
 - [ ] Create a draft PR to sort the changelog.
 - [ ] Create draft PRs to bump version in ``solidity`` and ``solc-js``.
       **Note**: The ``solc-js`` PR won't pass CI checks yet because it depends on the soljson binary from ``solc-bin``.
 - [ ] Create a draft of the release on github.
 - [ ] Create a draft PR to update soliditylang.org.
 - [ ] Create drafts of blog posts.
 - [ ] Prepare drafts of Twitter, Reddit and Solidity Forum announcements.

### Blog Post
 - [ ] Create a post on [solidity-website](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-website/tree/main/src/posts) in the ``Releases`` category and explain some of the new features or concepts.
 - [ ] Create a post on [solidity-website](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-website/tree/main/src/posts) in the ``Security Alerts`` category in case of important bug(s).
 - [ ] Get the posts reviewed and approved **before the release starts**.

### Changelog
 - [ ] Sort the changelog entries alphabetically and correct any errors you notice. Commit it.
 - [ ] Update the changelog to include a release date.
 - [ ] Run ``scripts/update_bugs_by_version.py`` to regenerate ``bugs_by_version.json`` from the changelog and ``bugs.json``.
       Make sure that the resulting ``bugs_by_version.json`` has a new, empty entry for the new version.
 - [ ] Commit changes, create a pull request and wait for the tests. Then merge it.
 - [ ] Copy the changelog into the release blog post.

### Create the Release
 - [ ] Create a [release on GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/new).
       Set the target to the ``develop`` branch and the tag to the new version, e.g. ``v0.8.5``.
       Include the following warning: ``**The release is still in progress. You may see broken links and binaries may not yet be available from all sources.**``.
       Do not publish it yet - click the ``Save draft`` button instead.
 - [ ] Thank voluntary contributors in the GitHub release notes.
       Use ``scripts/list_contributors.sh v<previous version>`` to get initial list of names.
       Remove different variants of the same name manually before using the output.
 - [ ] Check that all tests on the latest commit in ``develop`` are green.
 - [ ] Click the ``Publish release`` button on the release page, creating the tag.
       **Important: Must not be done before all the PRs, including changelog cleanup and date, are merged.**
 - [ ] Wait for the CI runs on the tag itself.

### Upload Release Artifacts and Publish Binaries
 - [ ] Switch to the tag that archives have to be created for.
 - [ ] Create the ``prerelease.txt`` file: (``echo -n > prerelease.txt``).
 - [ ] Run ``scripts/create_source_tarball.sh`` while being on the tag to create the source tarball. This will create the tarball in a directory called ``upload``.
 - [ ] Take the tarball from the upload directory (its name should be ``solidity_x.x.x.tar.gz``, otherwise ``prerelease.txt`` was missing in the step before) and upload the source tarball to the release page.
 - [ ] Take the ``github-binaries.tar`` tarball from ``c_release_binaries`` run of the tagged commit in circle-ci and add all binaries from it to the release page.
       Make sure it contains four binaries: ``solc-windows.exe``, ``solc-macos``, ``solc-static-linux`` and ``soljson.js``.
 - [ ] Take the ``solc-bin-binaries.tar`` tarball from ``c_release_binaries`` run of the tagged commit in circle-ci and add all binaries from it to solc-bin.
 - [ ] Run ``npm install`` if you've got a clean checkout of the solc-bin repo.
 - [ ] Run ``npm run update -- --reuse-hashes`` in ``solc-bin`` and verify that the script has updated ``list.js``, ``list.txt`` and ``list.json`` files correctly and that symlinks to the new release have been added in ``solc-bin/wasm/`` and ``solc-bin/emscripten-wasm32/``.
 - [ ] Create a pull request in solc-bin and merge.

### Homebrew and MacOS
 - [ ] Create a local fork of the repository at ``git@github.com:Homebrew/homebrew-core.git``
 - [ ] Make sure that ``brew`` is installed on your system, or use the official Homebrew docker container:
 ``docker run --interactive --tty --rm --pull always --volume "$(pwd):/homebrew-core" --workdir "/homebrew-core" homebrew/ubuntu22.04:latest /bin/bash``
#### Manual Update
 - [ ] Open the [``solidity`` formula in Homebrew core repository](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/s/solidity.rb) using your preferred text editor and update the following fields:
   - url: Update the URL to reflect the new source file for the updated version.
   - sha256: Replace with the new SHA256 checksum of the source file. You can obtain it using a command like:
     ``curl -L https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v$VERSION/solidity_$VERSION.tar.gz | sha256sum``
 - [ ] Test your changes locally by running the following command from the root directory of your fork: ``brew install --build-from-source ./Formula/s/solidity.rb``
 - [ ] Open a PR in the Homebrew repository.
#### Automatic Update
 - [ ] Create a GitHub token and run the following command: ``export HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN=your_token_here``
 - [ ] Run the following command to automatically update the formula and create a PR in the Homebrew repository: ``brew bump-formula-pr --version=$VERSION solidity``
 Note: the version should not include the prefix ``v``, e.g. ``X.Y.Z``.

### Docker
 - [ ] Run ``./scripts/docker_deploy_manual.sh v$VERSION``.

### PPA
 - [ ] Create ``.release_ppa_auth`` at the root of your local Solidity checkout and set ``LAUNCHPAD_EMAIL`` and ``LAUNCHPAD_KEYID`` to your key's email and key id.
 - [ ] Double-check that the ``DISTRIBUTIONS`` list in ``scripts/release_ppa.sh`` and ``scripts/deps-ppa/static_z3.sh`` contains the most recent versions of Ubuntu.
 - [ ] Make sure the [``~ethereum/cpp-build-deps`` PPA repository](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/cpp-build-deps) contains ``libz3-static-dev`` builds for all current versions of Ubuntu.
       Note that it may be included in the ``z3-static`` multipackage (follow the ``View package details`` link to check).
       If not present, run ``scripts/deps-ppa/static_z3.sh`` and wait for the builds to succeed before continuing.
 - [ ] Run ``scripts/release_ppa.sh v$VERSION`` to create the PPA release.
       This will create a single package containing static binary for older Ubuntu versions in the [``~ethereum/ethereum-static`` PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-static)
       and separate packages with dynamically-linked binaries for recent versions (those listed in ``DISTRIBUTIONS``) in the [``~ethereum/ethereum`` PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum).
 - [ ] Wait for the build to be finished and published for *all architectures* (currently we only build for ``amd64``, but we may add ``arm`` in the future).
       **SERIOUSLY: DO NOT PROCEED EARLIER!!!**
 - [ ] *After* the package with the static build is *published*, use it to create packages for older Ubuntu versions.
       Copy the static package to the [``~ethereum/ethereum`` PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum)
       for the destination series ``Trusty``, ``Xenial`` and ``Bionic`` while selecting ``Copy existing binaries``.

### Release solc-js
 - [ ] Wait until solc-bin was properly deployed. You can test this via remix - a test run through remix is advisable anyway.
 - [ ] Increment the version number, create a pull request for that, merge it after tests succeeded.
 - [ ] Create a tag using ``git tag --annotate v$VERSION`` and push it with ``git push --tags``.
 - [ ] Wait for the CI runs on the tag itself.
 - [ ] Take the ``solc-x.y.z.tgz`` artifact from ``build-package`` run on the tagged commit in circle-ci.
       Inspect the tarball to ensure that it contains an up-to-date compiler binary (``soljson.js``).
       See the section "Testing version of soljson.js": https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/wiki/Building-solc%E2%80%90js-from-source#testing-version-of-soljsonjs
 - [ ] Run ``npm publish solc-x.y.z.tgz`` to publish the newly created tarball.

### Post-release
 - [ ] Make sure the documentation for the new release has been published successfully.
       Go to the [documentation status page at ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/solidity/) and verify that the new version is listed, works and is marked as default.
 - [ ] Remove "still in progress" warning from the [release notes](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases).
 - [ ] Merge the [blog posts](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-website/pulls) related to the release.
 - [ ] Create a commit to increase the version number on ``develop`` in ``CMakeLists.txt`` and add a new skeleton changelog entry.
 - [ ] Update the release information section [in the source of soliditylang.org](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-website/blob/main/src/pages/index.tsx).
 - [ ] Announce on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/solidity_lang), including links to the release and the blog post.
 - [ ] Announce on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@solidity/), including links to the release and the blog post.
 - [ ] Share the announcement on Reddit in [``/r/ethdev``](https://reddit.com/r/ethdev/), cross-posted to [``/r/ethereum``](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/).
 - [ ] Share the announcement on the [Solidity forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) in the ``Announcements`` category.
 - [ ] Share the announcement on [Project Updates](https://discord.com/channels/420394352083337236/798974456704925696)
 - [ ] Share the announcement on [`#solidity` channel on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ethereum_solidity:gitter.im)
 - [ ] Share the announcement on [`#solc-tooling`](https://matrix.to/#/#solc-tooling:matrix.org)
 - [ ] If anything went wrong this time, mention it in [Learning from Past Releases](https://notes.ethereum.org/@solidity/release-mistakes).
 - [ ] Lean back, wait for bug reports and repeat from step 1 :).
