****************************
The Ethereum Virtual Machine
****************************

Overview
========

The Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM is the runtime environment
for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is not only sandboxed but
actually completely isolated, which means that code running
inside the EVM has no access to network, filesystem or other processes.
Smart contracts even have limited access to other smart contracts.

.. index:: ! account, address, storage, balance

Accounts
========

There are two kinds of accounts in Ethereum which share the same
address space: **External accounts** that are controlled by
public-private key pairs (i.e. humans) and **contract accounts** which are
controlled by the code stored together with the account.

The address of an external account is determined from
the public key while the address of a contract is
determined at the time the contract is created
(it is derived from the creator address and the number
of transactions sent from that address, the so-called "nonce").

Regardless of whether or not the account stores code, the two types are
treated equally by the EVM.

Every account has a persistent key-value store mapping 256-bit words to 256-bit
words called **storage**.

Furthermore, every account has a **balance** in
Ether (in "Wei" to be exact, `1 ether` is `10**18 wei`) which can be modified by sending transactions that
include Ether.

.. index:: ! transaction

Transactions
============

A transaction is a message that is sent from one account to another
account (which might be the same or empty, see below).
It can include binary data (which is called "payload") and Ether.

If the target account contains code, that code is executed and
the payload is provided as input data.

If the target account is not set (the transaction does not have
a recipient or the recipient is set to ``null``), the transaction
creates a **new contract**.
As already mentioned, the address of that contract is not
the zero address but an address derived from the sender and
its number of transactions sent (the "nonce"). The payload
of such a contract creation transaction is taken to be
EVM bytecode and executed. The output data of this execution is
permanently stored as the code of the contract.
This means that in order to create a contract, you do not
send the actual code of the contract, but in fact code that
returns that code when executed.

.. note::
  While a contract is being created, its code is still empty.
  Because of that, you should not call back into the
  contract under construction until its constructor has
  finished executing.

.. index:: ! gas, ! gas price

Gas
===

Upon creation, each transaction is charged with a certain amount of **gas**,
whose purpose is to limit the amount of work that is needed to execute
the transaction and to pay for this execution at the same time. While the EVM executes the
transaction, the gas is gradually depleted according to specific rules.

The **gas price** is a value set by the creator of the transaction, who
has to pay ``gas_price * gas`` up front from the sending account.
If some gas is left after the execution, it is refunded to the creator in the same way.

If the gas is used up at any point (i.e. it would be negative),
an out-of-gas exception is triggered, which reverts all modifications
made to the state in the current call frame.

.. index:: ! storage, ! memory, ! stack

Storage, Memory and the Stack
=============================

The Ethereum Virtual Machine has three areas where it can store data-
storage, memory and the stack, which are explained in the following
paragraphs.

Each account has a data area called **storage**, which is persistent between function calls
and transactions.
Storage is a key-value store that maps 256-bit words to 256-bit words.
It is not possible to enumerate storage from within a contract and it is
comparatively costly to read, and even more to modify storage.
A contract can neither read nor write to any storage apart from its own.

The second data area is called **memory**, of which a contract obtains
a freshly cleared instance for each message call. Memory is linear and can be
addressed at byte level, but reads are limited to a width of 256 bits, while writes
can be either 8 bits or 256 bits wide. Memory is expanded by a word (256-bit), when
accessing (either reading or writing) a previously untouched memory word (i.e. any offset
within a word). At the time of expansion, the cost in gas must be paid. Memory is more
costly the larger it grows (it scales quadratically).

The EVM is not a register machine but a stack machine, so all
computations are performed on a data area called the **stack**. It has a maximum size of
1024 elements and contains words of 256 bits. Access to the stack is
limited to the top end in the following way:
It is possible to copy one of
the topmost 16 elements to the top of the stack or swap the
topmost element with one of the 16 elements below it.
All other operations take the topmost two (or one, or more, depending on
the operation) elements from the stack and push the result onto the stack.
Of course it is possible to move stack elements to storage or memory
in order to get deeper access to the stack,
but it is not possible to just access arbitrary elements deeper in the stack
without first removing the top of the stack.

.. index:: ! instruction

Instruction Set
===============

The instruction set of the EVM is kept minimal in order to avoid
incorrect or inconsistent implementations which could cause consensus problems.
All instructions operate on the basic data type, 256-bit words or on slices of memory
(or other byte arrays).
The usual arithmetic, bit, logical and comparison operations are present.
Conditional and unconditional jumps are possible. Furthermore,
contracts can access relevant properties of the current block
like its number and timestamp.

For a complete list, please see the :ref:`list of opcodes <opcodes>` as part of the inline
assembly documentation.

.. index:: ! message call, function;call

Message Calls
=============

Contracts can call other contracts or send Ether to non-contract
accounts by the means of message calls. Message calls are similar
to transactions, in that they have a source, a target, data payload,
Ether, gas and return data. In fact, every transaction consists of
a top-level message call which in turn can create further message calls.

A contract can decide how much of its remaining **gas** should be sent
with the inner message call and how much it wants to retain.
If an out-of-gas exception happens in the inner call (or any
other exception), this will be signaled by an error value put onto the stack.
In this case, only the gas sent together with the call is used up.
In Solidity, the calling contract causes a manual exception by default in
such situations, so that exceptions "bubble up" the call stack.

As already said, the called contract (which can be the same as the caller)
will receive a freshly cleared instance of memory and has access to the
call payload - which will be provided in a separate area called the **calldata**.
After it has finished execution, it can return data which will be stored at
a location in the caller's memory preallocated by the caller.
All such calls are fully synchronous.

Calls are **limited** to a depth of 1024, which means that for more complex
operations, loops should be preferred over recursive calls. Furthermore,
only 63/64th of the gas can be forwarded in a message call, which causes a
depth limit of a little less than 1000 in practice.

.. index:: delegatecall, callcode, library

Delegatecall / Callcode and Libraries
=====================================

There exists a special variant of a message call, named **delegatecall**
which is identical to a message call apart from the fact that
the code at the target address is executed in the context of the calling
contract and ``msg.sender`` and ``msg.value`` do not change their values.

This means that a contract can dynamically load code from a different
address at runtime. Storage, current address and balance still
refer to the calling contract, only the code is taken from the called address.

This makes it possible to implement the "library" feature in Solidity:
Reusable library code that can be applied to a contract's storage, e.g. in
order to implement a complex data structure.

.. index:: log

Logs
====

It is possible to store data in a specially indexed data structure
that maps all the way up to the block level. This feature called **logs**
is used by Solidity in order to implement :ref:`events <events>`.
Contracts cannot access log data after it has been created, but they
can be efficiently accessed from outside the blockchain.
Since some part of the log data is stored in `bloom filters <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter>`_, it is
possible to search for this data in an efficient and cryptographically
secure way, so network peers that do not download the whole blockchain
(so-called "light clients") can still find these logs.

.. index:: contract creation

Create
======

Contracts can even create other contracts using a special opcode (i.e.
they do not simply call the zero address as a transaction would). The only difference between
these **create calls** and normal message calls is that the payload data is
executed and the result stored as code and the caller / creator
receives the address of the new contract on the stack.

.. index:: selfdestruct, self-destruct, deactivate

Deactivate and Self-destruct
============================

The only way to remove code from the blockchain is when a contract at that address performs the ``selfdestruct`` operation. The remaining Ether stored at that address is sent to a designated target and then the storage and code is removed from the state. Removing the contract in theory sounds like a good idea, but it is potentially dangerous, as if someone sends Ether to removed contracts, the Ether is forever lost.

.. note::
    Even if a contract's code does not contain a call to ``selfdestruct``, it can still perform that operation using ``delegatecall`` or ``callcode``.

If you want to deactivate your contracts, you should instead **disable** them by changing some internal state which causes all functions to revert. This makes it impossible to use the contract, as it returns Ether immediately.

.. warning::
    Even if a contract is removed by "selfdestruct", it is still part of the history of the blockchain and probably retained by most Ethereum nodes. So using "selfdestruct" is not the same as deleting data from a hard disk.
