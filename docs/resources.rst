Solidity Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Dapp <https://dapp.tools/dapp/>`_
    Build tool, package manager, and deployment assistant for Solidity.

* `Solidity REPL <https://github.com/raineorshine/solidity-repl>`_
    Try Solidity instantly with a command-line Solidity console.

* `solgraph <https://github.com/raineorshine/solgraph>`_
    Visualize Solidity control flow and highlight potential security vulnerabilities.

* `Doxity <https://github.com/DigixGlobal/doxity>`_
    Documentation Generator for Solidity.

* `evmdis <https://github.com/Arachnid/evmdis>`_
    EVM Disassembler that performs static analysis on the bytecode to provide a higher level of abstraction than raw EVM operations.

* `ABI to solidity interface converter <https://gist.github.com/chriseth/8f533d133fa0c15b0d6eaf3ec502c82b>`_
    A script for generating contract interfaces from the ABI of a smart contract.

* `Securify <https://securify.ch/>`_
    Fully automated online static analyzer for smart contracts, providing a security report based on vulnerability patterns.

* `Sūrya <https://github.com/ConsenSys/surya/>`_
    Utility tool for smart contract systems, offering a number of visual outputs and information about the contracts' structure. Also supports querying the function call graph.

* `EVM Lab <https://github.com/ethereum/evmlab/>`_
    Rich tool package to interact with the EVM. Includes a VM, Etherchain API, and a trace-viewer with gas cost display.

.. note::
  Information like variable names, comments, and source code formatting is lost in the compilation process and it is not possible to completely recover the original source code. Decompiling smart contracts to view the original source code might not be possible, or the end result that useful.
