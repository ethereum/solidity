***********
Inheritance
***********

Solidity supports multiple inheritance including polymorphism.

Polymorphism means that a function call (internal and external)
always executes the function of the same name (and parameter types)
in the most derived contract in the inheritance hierarchy.
This has to be explicitly enabled on each function in the
hierarchy using the ``virtual`` and ``override`` keywords.
See :ref:`Function Overriding <function-overriding>` for more details.

It is possible to call functions further up in the inheritance
hierarchy internally by explicitly specifying the contract
using ``ContractName.functionName()`` or using ``super.functionName()``
if you want to call the function one level higher up in
the flattened inheritance hierarchy (see below).

When a contract inherits from other contracts, only a single
contract is created on the blockchain, and the code from all the base contracts
is compiled into the created contract. This means that all internal calls
to functions of base contracts also just use internal function calls
(``super.f(..)`` will use JUMP and not a message call).

State variable shadowing is considered as an error.  A derived contract can
only declare a state variable ``x``, if there is no visible state variable
with the same name in any of its bases.

The general inheritance system is very similar to
`Python's <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance>`_,
especially concerning multiple inheritance, but there are also
some :ref:`differences <multi-inheritance>`.

Details are given in the following example.

.. code-block:: solidity

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
    pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

    contract Owned {
        address payable owner;
        constructor() { owner = payable(msg.sender); }
    }

    // Use `is` to derive from another contract. Derived
    // contracts can access all non-private members including
    // internal functions and state variables. These cannot be
    // accessed externally via `this`, though.
    contract Emittable is Owned {
        event Emitted();

        // The keyword `virtual` means that the function can change
        // its behavior in derived classes ("overriding").
        function emitEvent() virtual public {
            if (msg.sender == owner)
                emit Emitted();
        }
    }

    // These abstract contracts are only provided to make the
    // interface known to the compiler. Note the function
    // without body. If a contract does not implement all
    // functions it can only be used as an interface.
    abstract contract Config {
        function lookup(uint id) public virtual returns (address adr);
    }

    abstract contract NameReg {
        function register(bytes32 name) public virtual;
        function unregister() public virtual;
    }

    // Multiple inheritance is possible. Note that `Owned` is
    // also a base class of `Emittable`, yet there is only a single
    // instance of `Owned` (as for virtual inheritance in C++).
    contract Named is Owned, Emittable {
        constructor(bytes32 name) {
            Config config = Config(0xD5f9D8D94886E70b06E474c3fB14Fd43E2f23970);
            NameReg(config.lookup(1)).register(name);
        }

        // Functions can be overridden by another function with the same name and
        // the same number/types of inputs. If the overriding function has different
        // types of output parameters, that causes an error.
        // Both local and message-based function calls take these overrides
        // into account.
        // If you want the function to override, you need to use the
        // `override` keyword. You need to specify the `virtual` keyword again
        // if you want this function to be overridden again.
        function emitEvent() public virtual override {
            if (msg.sender == owner) {
                Config config = Config(0xD5f9D8D94886E70b06E474c3fB14Fd43E2f23970);
                NameReg(config.lookup(1)).unregister();
                // It is still possible to call a specific
                // overridden function.
                Emittable.emitEvent();
            }
        }
    }


    // If a constructor takes an argument, it needs to be
    // provided in the header or modifier-invocation-style at
    // the constructor of the derived contract (see below).
    contract PriceFeed is Owned, Emittable, Named("GoldFeed") {
        uint info;

        function updateInfo(uint newInfo) public {
            if (msg.sender == owner) info = newInfo;
        }

        // Here, we only specify `override` and not `virtual`.
        // This means that contracts deriving from `PriceFeed`
        // cannot change the behavior of `emitEvent` anymore.
        function emitEvent() public override(Emittable, Named) { Named.emitEvent(); }
        function get() public view returns(uint r) { return info; }
    }

Note that above, we call ``Emittable.emitEvent()`` to "forward" the
emit event request. The way this is done is problematic, as
seen in the following example:

.. code-block:: solidity

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
    pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

    contract Owned {
        address payable owner;
        constructor() { owner = payable(msg.sender); }
    }

    contract Emittable is Owned {
        event Emitted();

        function emitEvent() virtual public {
            if (msg.sender == owner) {
                emit Emitted();
            }
        }
    }

    contract Base1 is Emittable {
        event Base1Emitted();
        function emitEvent() public virtual override {
            /* Here, we emit an event to simulate some Base1 logic */
            emit Base1Emitted();
            Emittable.emitEvent();
        }
    }

    contract Base2 is Emittable {
        event Base2Emitted();
        function emitEvent() public virtual override {
            /* Here, we emit an event to simulate some Base2 logic */
            emit Base2Emitted();
            Emittable.emitEvent();
        }
    }

    contract Final is Base1, Base2 {
        event FinalEmitted();
        function emitEvent() public override(Base1, Base2) {
            /* Here, we emit an event to simulate some Final logic */
            emit FinalEmitted();
            Base2.emitEvent();
        }
    }

A call to ``Final.emitEvent()`` will call ``Base2.emitEvent`` because we specify it
explicitly in the final override, but this function will bypass
``Base1.emitEvent``, resulting in the following sequence of events:
``FinalEmitted -> Base2Emitted -> Emitted``, instead of the expected sequence:
``FinalEmitted -> Base2Emitted -> Base1Emitted -> Emitted``.
The way around this is to use ``super``:

.. code-block:: solidity

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
    pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

    contract Owned {
        address payable owner;
        constructor() { owner = payable(msg.sender); }
    }

    contract Emittable is Owned {
        event Emitted();

        function emitEvent() virtual public {
            if (msg.sender == owner) {
                emit Emitted();
            }
        }
    }

    contract Base1 is Emittable {
        event Base1Emitted();
        function emitEvent() public virtual override {
            /* Here, we emit an event to simulate some Base1 logic */
            emit Base1Emitted();
            super.emitEvent();
        }
    }


    contract Base2 is Emittable {
        event Base2Emitted();
        function emitEvent() public virtual override {
            /* Here, we emit an event to simulate some Base2 logic */
            emit Base2Emitted();
            super.emitEvent();
        }
    }

    contract Final is Base1, Base2 {
        event FinalEmitted();
        function emitEvent() public override(Base1, Base2) {
            /* Here, we emit an event to simulate some Final logic */
            emit FinalEmitted();
            super.emitEvent();
        }
    }

If ``Final`` calls a function of ``super``, it does not simply
call this function on one of its base contracts.  Rather, it
calls this function on the next base contract in the final
inheritance graph, so it will call ``Base2.emitEvent()`` (note that
the final inheritance sequence is -- starting with the most
derived contract: Final, Base2, Base1, Emittable, Owned).
The actual function that is called when using super is
not known in the context of the class where it is used,
although its type is known. This is similar for ordinary
virtual method lookup.

.. index:: ! overriding;function

.. _function-overriding:

Function Overriding
===================

Base functions can be overridden by inheriting contracts to change their
behavior if they are marked as ``virtual``. The overriding function must then
use the ``override`` keyword in the function header.
The overriding function may only change the visibility of the overridden function from ``external`` to ``public``.
The mutability may be changed to a more strict one following the order:
``nonpayable`` can be overridden by ``view`` and ``pure``. ``view`` can be overridden by ``pure``.
``payable`` is an exception and cannot be changed to any other mutability.

The following example demonstrates changing mutability and visibility:

.. code-block:: solidity

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
    pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

    contract Base
    {
        function foo() virtual external view {}
    }

    contract Middle is Base {}

    contract Inherited is Middle
    {
        function foo() override public pure {}
    }

For multiple inheritance, the most derived base contracts that define the same
function must be specified explicitly after the ``override`` keyword.
In other words, you have to specify all base contracts that define the same function
and have not yet been overridden by another base contract (on some path through the inheritance graph).
Additionally, if a contract inherits the same function from multiple (unrelated)
bases, it has to explicitly override it:

.. code-block:: solidity

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
    pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

    contract Base1
    {
        function foo() virtual public {}
    }

    contract Base2
    {
        function foo() virtual public {}
    }

    contract Inherited is Base1, Base2
    {
        // Derives from multiple bases defining foo(), so we must explicitly
        // override it
        function foo() public override(Base1, Base2) {}
    }

An explicit override specifier is not required if
the function is defined in a common base contract
or if there is a unique function in a common base contract
that already overrides all other functions.

.. code-block:: solidity

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
    pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

    contract A { function f() public pure{} }
    contract B is A {}
    contract C is A {}
    // No explicit override required
    contract D is B, C {}

More formally, it is not required to override a function (directly or
indirectly) inherited from multiple bases if there is a base contract
that is part of all override paths for the signature, and (1) that
base implements the function and no paths from the current contract
to the base mentions a function with that signature or (2) that base
does not implement the function and there is at most one mention of
the function in all paths from the current contract to that base.

In this sense, an override path for a signature is a path through
the inheritance graph that starts at the contract under consideration
and ends at a contract mentioning a function with that signature
that does not override.

If you do not mark a function that overrides as ``virtual``, derived
contracts can no longer change the behavior of that function.

.. note::

  Functions with the ``private`` visibility cannot be ``virtual``.

.. note::

  Functions without implementation have to be marked ``virtual``
  outside of interfaces. In interfaces, all functions are
  automatically considered ``virtual``.

.. note::

  Starting from Solidity 0.8.8, the ``override`` keyword is not
  required when overriding an interface function, except for the
  case where the function is defined in multiple bases.


Public state variables can override external functions if the
parameter and return types of the function matches the getter function
of the variable:

.. code-block:: solidity

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
    pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

    contract A
    {
        function f() external view virtual returns(uint) { return 5; }
    }

    contract B is A
    {
        uint public override f;
    }

.. note::

  While public state variables can override external functions, they themselves cannot
  be overridden.

.. index:: ! overriding;modifier

.. _modifier-overriding:

Modifier Overriding
===================

Function modifiers can override each other. This works in the same way as
:ref:`function overriding <function-overriding>` (except that there is no overloading for modifiers). The
``virtual`` keyword must be used on the overridden modifier
and the ``override`` keyword must be used in the overriding modifier:

.. code-block:: solidity

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
    pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

    contract Base
    {
        modifier foo() virtual {_;}
    }

    contract Inherited is Base
    {
        modifier foo() override {_;}
    }


In case of multiple inheritance, all direct base contracts must be specified
explicitly:

.. code-block:: solidity

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
    pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

    contract Base1
    {
        modifier foo() virtual {_;}
    }

    contract Base2
    {
        modifier foo() virtual {_;}
    }

    contract Inherited is Base1, Base2
    {
        modifier foo() override(Base1, Base2) {_;}
    }



.. index:: ! constructor

.. _constructor:

Constructors
============

A constructor is an optional function declared with the ``constructor`` keyword
which is executed upon contract creation, and where you can run contract
initialization code.

Before the constructor code is executed, state variables are initialised to
their specified value if you initialise them inline, or their :ref:`default value<default-value>` if you do not.

After the constructor has run, the final code of the contract is deployed
to the blockchain. The deployment of
the code costs additional gas linear to the length of the code.
This code includes all functions that are part of the public interface
and all functions that are reachable from there through function calls.
It does not include the constructor code or internal functions that are
only called from the constructor.

If there is no
constructor, the contract will assume the default constructor, which is
equivalent to ``constructor() {}``. For example:

.. code-block:: solidity

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
    pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

    abstract contract A {
        uint public a;

        constructor(uint a_) {
            a = a_;
        }
    }

    contract B is A(1) {
        constructor() {}
    }

You can use internal parameters in a constructor (for example storage pointers). In this case,
the contract has to be marked :ref:`abstract <abstract-contract>`, because these parameters
cannot be assigned valid values from outside but only through the constructors of derived contracts.

.. warning::
    Prior to version 0.4.22, constructors were defined as functions with the same name as the contract.
    This syntax was deprecated and is not allowed anymore in version 0.5.0.

.. warning::
    Prior to version 0.7.0, you had to specify the visibility of constructors as either
    ``internal`` or ``public``.


.. index:: ! base;constructor, inheritance list, contract;abstract, abstract contract

Arguments for Base Constructors
===============================

The constructors of all the base contracts will be called following the
linearization rules explained below. If the base constructors have arguments,
derived contracts need to specify all of them. This can be done in two ways:

.. code-block:: solidity

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
    pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

    contract Base {
        uint x;
        constructor(uint x_) { x = x_; }
    }

    // Either directly specify in the inheritance list...
    contract Derived1 is Base(7) {
        constructor() {}
    }

    // or through a "modifier" of the derived constructor...
    contract Derived2 is Base {
        constructor(uint y) Base(y * y) {}
    }

    // or declare abstract...
    abstract contract Derived3 is Base {
    }

    // and have the next concrete derived contract initialize it.
    contract DerivedFromDerived is Derived3 {
        constructor() Base(10 + 10) {}
    }

One way is directly in the inheritance list (``is Base(7)``).  The other is in
the way a modifier is invoked as part of
the derived constructor (``Base(y * y)``). The first way to
do it is more convenient if the constructor argument is a
constant and defines the behavior of the contract or
describes it. The second way has to be used if the
constructor arguments of the base depend on those of the
derived contract. Arguments have to be given either in the
inheritance list or in modifier-style in the derived constructor.
Specifying arguments in both places is an error.

If a derived contract does not specify the arguments to all of its base
contracts' constructors, it must be declared abstract. In that case, when
another contract derives from it, that other contract's inheritance list
or constructor must provide the necessary parameters
for all base classes that haven't had their parameters specified (otherwise,
that other contract must be declared abstract as well). For example, in the above
code snippet, see ``Derived3`` and ``DerivedFromDerived``.

.. index:: ! inheritance;multiple, ! linearization, ! C3 linearization

.. _multi-inheritance:

Multiple Inheritance and Linearization
======================================

Languages that allow multiple inheritance have to deal with
several problems.  One is the `Diamond Problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem>`_.
Solidity is similar to Python in that it uses "`C3 Linearization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization>`_"
to force a specific order in the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of base classes. This
results in the desirable property of monotonicity but
disallows some inheritance graphs. Especially, the order in
which the base classes are given in the ``is`` directive is
important: You have to list the direct base contracts
in the order from "most base-like" to "most derived".
Note that this order is the reverse of the one used in Python.

Another simplifying way to explain this is that when a function is called that
is defined multiple times in different contracts, the given bases
are searched from right to left (left to right in Python) in a depth-first manner,
stopping at the first match. If a base contract has already been searched, it is skipped.

In the following code, Solidity will give the
error "Linearization of inheritance graph impossible".

.. code-block:: solidity

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
    pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.9.0;

    contract X {}
    contract A is X {}
    // This will not compile
    contract C is A, X {}

The reason for this is that ``C`` requests ``X`` to override ``A``
(by specifying ``A, X`` in this order), but ``A`` itself
requests to override ``X``, which is a contradiction that
cannot be resolved.

Due to the fact that you have to explicitly override a function
that is inherited from multiple bases without a unique override,
C3 linearization is not too important in practice.

One area where inheritance linearization is especially important and perhaps not as clear is when there are multiple constructors in the inheritance hierarchy. The constructors will always be executed in the linearized order, regardless of the order in which their arguments are provided in the inheriting contract's constructor.  For example:

.. code-block:: solidity

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
    pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

    contract Base1 {
        constructor() {}
    }

    contract Base2 {
        constructor() {}
    }

    // Constructors are executed in the following order:
    //  1 - Base1
    //  2 - Base2
    //  3 - Derived1
    contract Derived1 is Base1, Base2 {
        constructor() Base1() Base2() {}
    }

    // Constructors are executed in the following order:
    //  1 - Base2
    //  2 - Base1
    //  3 - Derived2
    contract Derived2 is Base2, Base1 {
        constructor() Base2() Base1() {}
    }

    // Constructors are still executed in the following order:
    //  1 - Base2
    //  2 - Base1
    //  3 - Derived3
    contract Derived3 is Base2, Base1 {
        constructor() Base1() Base2() {}
    }


Inheriting Different Kinds of Members of the Same Name
======================================================

The only situations where, due to inheritance, a contract may contain multiple definitions sharing
the same name are:

- Overloading of functions.
- Overriding of virtual functions.
- Overriding of external virtual functions by state variable getters.
- Overriding of virtual modifiers.
- Overloading of events.
