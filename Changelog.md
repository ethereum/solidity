 * SMTChecker: Add CLI option ``--model-checker-bmc-loop-iterations`` and a JSON option ``settings.modelChecker.bmcLoopIterations`` that specify how many loop iterations the BMC engine should unroll. Note that false negatives are possible when unrolling loops. This is due to the possibility that bmc loop iteration setting is less than actual number of iterations needed to complete a loop.

### 0.5.0 (2018-11-13)

How to update your code:
 * Change every ``.call()`` to a ``.call("")`` and every ``.call(signature, a, b, c)`` to use ``.call(abi.encodeWithSignature(signature, a, b, c))`` (the last one only works for value types).
 * Change every ``keccak256(a, b, c)`` to ``keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b, c))``.
 * Add ``public`` to every function and ``external`` to every fallback or interface function that does not specify its visibility already.
 * Make your fallback functions ``external``.
 * Explicitly state the data location for all variables of struct, array or mapping types (including function parameters), e.g. change ``uint[] x = m_x`` to ``uint[] storage x = m_x``. Note that ``external`` functions require parameters with a data location of ``calldata``.
 * Explicitly convert values of contract type to addresses before using an ``address`` member. Example: if ``c`` is a contract, change ``c.transfer(...)`` to ``address(c).transfer(...)``.
 * Declare variables and especially function arguments as ``address payable``, if you want to call ``transfer`` on them.

Breaking Changes:
 * ABI Encoder: Properly pad data from calldata (``msg.data`` and external function parameters). Use ``abi.encodePacked`` for unpadded encoding.
 * C API (``libsolc`` / raw ``soljson.js``): Removed the ``version``, ``license``, ``compileSingle``, ``compileJSON``, ``compileJSONCallback`` methods
   and replaced them with the ``solidity_license``, ``solidity_version`` and ``solidity_compile`` methods.
 * Code Generator: Signed right shift uses proper arithmetic shift, i.e. rounding towards negative infinity. Warning: this may silently change the semantics of existing code!
 * Code Generator: Revert at runtime if calldata is too short or points out of bounds. This is done inside the ``ABI decoder`` and therefore also applies to ``abi.decode()``.
 * Code Generator: Use ``STATICCALL`` for ``pure`` and ``view`` functions. This was already the case in the experimental 0.5.0 mode.
 * Commandline interface: Remove obsolete ``--formal`` option.
 * Commandline interface: Rename the ``--julia`` option to ``--yul``.
 * Commandline interface: Require ``-`` if standard input is used as source.

### 0.4.0 (2016-09-08)

This release deliberately breaks backwards compatibility mostly to
enforce some safety features. The most important change is that you have
to explicitly specify if functions can receive ether via the ``payable``
modifier. Furthermore, more situations cause exceptions to be thrown.

Minimal changes to be made for upgrade:
 - Add ``payable`` to all functions that want to receive Ether
   (including the constructor and the fallback function).
 - Change ``_`` to ``_;`` in modifiers.
 - Add version pragma to each file: ``pragma solidity ^0.4.0;``

Breaking Changes:

 * Source files have to specify the compiler version they are
   compatible with using e.g. ``pragma solidity ^0.4.0;`` or
   ``pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.4.8;``
 * Functions that want to receive Ether have to specify the
   new ``payable`` modifier (otherwise they throw).
 * Contracts that want to receive Ether with a plain "send"
   have to implement a fallback function with the ``payable``
   modifier. Contracts now throw if no payable fallback
   function is defined and no function matches the signature.
 * Failing contract creation through "new" throws.
 * Division / modulus by zero throws.
 * Function call throws if target contract does not have code
 * Modifiers are required to contain ``_`` (use ``if (false) _`` as a workaround if needed).
 * Modifiers: return does not skip part in modifier after ``_``.
 * Placeholder statement `_` in modifier now requires explicit `;`.
 * ``ecrecover`` now returns zero if the input is malformed (it previously returned garbage).
 * The ``constant`` keyword cannot be used for constructors or the fallback function.
 * Removed ``--interface`` (Solidity interface) output option
 * JSON AST: General cleanup, renamed many nodes to match their C++ names.
 * JSON output: ``srcmap-runtime`` renamed to ``srcmapRuntime``.
 * Moved (and reworked) standard library contracts from inside the compiler to github.com/ethereum/solidity/std
   (``import "std";`` or ``import owned;`` do not work anymore).
 * Confusing and undocumented keyword ``after`` was removed.
 * New reserved words: ``abstract``, ``hex``, ``interface``, ``payable``, ``pure``, ``static``, ``view``.

Features:

 * Hexadecimal string literals: ``hex"ab1248fe"``
 * Internal: Inline assembly usable by the code generator.
 * Commandline interface: Using ``-`` as filename allows reading from stdin.
 * Interface JSON: Fallback function is now part of the ABI.
 * Interface: Version string now *SemVer* compatible.
 * Code generator: Do not provide "new account gas" if we know the called account exists.

Bugfixes:

 * JSON AST: Nodes were added at wrong parent
 * Why3 translator: Crash fix for exponentiation
 * Commandline Interface: linking libraries with underscores in their name.
 * Type Checker: Fallback function cannot return data anymore.

Bugfixes:

 * Type Checking: Dynamic return types were removed when fetching data from external calls, now they are replaced by an "unusable" type.

### 0.3.4 (2016-05-31)

No change outside documentation.

### 0.3.3 (2016-05-27)

 * Allow internal library functions to be called (by "inlining")

### 0.3.2 (2016-04-18)

 * Bugfix: Inline assembly parser: `byte` opcode was unusable
 * Bugfix: Error reporting: tokens for variably-sized types were not converted to string properly
 * Bugfix: Dynamic arrays of structs were not deleted correctly.
 * Bugfix: Static arrays in constructor parameter list were not decoded correctly.

### 0.3.1 (2016-03-31)

 * Inline assembly
 * Bugfix: Code generation: array access with narrow types did not clean higher order bits
 * Bugfix: Error reporting: error reporting with unknown source location caused a crash

### 0.3.0 (2016-03-11)

BREAKING CHANGES:

 * Added new keywords `assembly`, `foreign`, `fixed`, `ufixed`, `fixedNxM`, `ufixedNxM` (for various values of M and N), `timestamp`
 * Number constant division does not round to integer, but to a fixed point type (e.g. `1 / 2 != 1`, but `1 / 2 == 0.5`).
 * Library calls now default to use DELEGATECALL (e.g. called library functions see the same value as the calling function for `msg.value` and `msg.sender`).
 * `<address>.delegatecall` as a low-level calling interface

Bugfixes:
 * Fixed a bug in the optimizer that resulted in comparisons being wrong.


### 0.2.2 (2016-02-17)

 * Index access for types `bytes1`, ..., `bytes32` (only read access for now).
 * Bugfix: Type checker crash for wrong number of base constructor parameters.

### 0.2.1 (2016-01-30)

 * Inline arrays, i.e. `var y = [1,x,f()];` if there is a common type for `1`, `x` and `f()`. Note that the result is always a fixed-length memory array and conversion to dynamic-length memory arrays is not yet possible.
 * Import similar to ECMAScript6 import (`import "abc.sol" as d` and `import {x, y} from "abc.sol"`).
 * Commandline compiler solc automatically resolves missing imports and allows for "include directories".
 * Conditional: `x ? y : z`
 * Bugfix: Fixed several bugs where the optimizer generated invalid code.
 * Bugfix: Enums and structs were not accessible to other contracts.
 * Bugfix: Fixed segfault connected to function parameter types, appeared during gas estimation.
 * Bugfix: Type checker crash for wrong number of base constructor parameters.
 * Bugfix: Allow function overloads with different array types.
 * Bugfix: Allow assignments of type `(x) = 7`.
 * Bugfix: Type `uint176` was not available.
 * Bugfix: Fixed crash during type checking concerning constructor calls.
 * Bugfix: Fixed crash during code generation concerning invalid accessors for struct types.
 * Bugfix: Fixed crash during code generating concerning computing a hash of a struct type.

### 0.2.0 (2015-12-02)

 * **Breaking Change**: `new ContractName.value(10)()` has to be written as `(new ContractName).value(10)()`
 * Added `selfdestruct` as an alias for `suicide`.
 * Allocation of memory arrays using `new`.
 * Binding library functions to types via `using x for y`
 * `addmod` and `mulmod` (modular addition and modular multiplication with arbitrary intermediate precision)
 * Bugfix: Constructor arguments of fixed array type were not read correctly.
 * Bugfix: Memory allocation of structs containing arrays or strings.
 * Bugfix: Data location for explicit memory parameters in libraries was set to storage.

### 0.1.7 (2015-11-17)

 * Improved error messages for unexpected tokens.
 * Proof-of-concept transcompilation to why3 for formal verification of contracts.
 * Bugfix: Arrays (also strings) as indexed parameters of events.
 * Bugfix: Writing to elements of `bytes` or `string` overwrite others.
 * Bugfix: "Successor block not found" on Windows.
 * Bugfix: Using string literals in tuples.
 * Bugfix: Cope with invalid commit hash in version for libraries.
 * Bugfix: Some test framework fixes on windows.

### 0.1.6 (2015-10-16)

 * `.push()` for dynamic storage arrays.
 * Tuple expressions (`(1,2,3)` or `return (1,2,3);`)
 * Declaration and assignment of multiple variables (`var (x,y,) = (1,2,3,4,5);` or `var (x,y) = f();`)
 * Destructuring assignment (`(x,y,) = (1,2,3)`)
 * Bugfix: Internal error about usage of library function with invalid types.
 * Bugfix: Correctly parse `Library.structType a` at statement level.
 * Bugfix: Correctly report source locations of parenthesized expressions (as part of "tuple" story).

### 0.1.5 (2015-10-07)

 * Breaking change in storage encoding: Encode short byte arrays and strings together with their length in storage.
 * Report warnings
 * Allow storage reference types for public library functions.
 * Access to types declared in other contracts and libraries via `.`.
 * Version stamp at beginning of runtime bytecode of libraries.
 * Bugfix: Problem with initialized string state variables and dynamic data in constructor.
 * Bugfix: Resolve dependencies concerning `new` automatically.
 * Bugfix: Allow four indexed arguments for anonymous events.
 * Bugfix: Detect too large integer constants in functions that accept arbitrary parameters.

 * Bugfix: Returning fixed-size arrays.
 * Bugfix: combined-json output of solc.
 * Bugfix: Accessing fixed-size array return values.
 * Bugfix: Disallow assignment from literal strings to storage pointers.
 * Refactoring: Move type checking into its own module.

### 0.1.3 (2015-09-25)

 * `throw` statement.
 * Libraries that contain functions which are called via CALLCODE.
 * Linker stage for compiler to insert other contract's addresses (used for libraries).
 * Compiler option to output runtime part of contracts.
 * Compile-time out of bounds check for access to fixed-size arrays by integer constants.

 * Strings can be used as mapping keys.
 * Clone contracts.
 * Mapping members are skipped for structs in memory.
 * Use only a single stack slot for storage references.
 * Improved error message for wrong argument count. (#2456)
 * Bugfix: Fix comparison between `bytesXX` types. (#2087)
