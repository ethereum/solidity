In this section, we will show how easy it is to create a
completely binding auction contract on Ethereum.
We will start with an open auction where everyone
can see the bids that are made and then extend this
contract into a blind auction where it is not
possible to see the actual bid until the bidding
period ends.

## Simple Open Auction

The general idea of the following simple auction contract
is that everyone can send their bids during
a bidding period. The bids already include sending
money / ether in order to bind the bidders to their
bid. If the highest bid is raised, the previously
highest bidder gets her money back.
After the end of the bidding period, the
contract has to be called manually for the
beneficiary to receive his money - contracts cannot
activate themselves.

contract SimpleAuction {
    // Parameters of the auction. Times are either
    // absolute unix timestamps (seconds since 1970-01-01)
    // ore time periods in seconds.
    address public beneficiary;
    uint public auctionStart;
    uint public biddingTime;

    // Current state of the auction.
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    // Set to true at the end, disallows any change
    bool ended;

    // Events that will be fired on changes.
    event HighestBidIncreased(address bidder, uint amount);
    event AuctionEnded(address winner, uint amount);

    // The following is a so-called natspec comment,
    // recognizable by the three slashes.
    // It will be shown when the user is asked to
    // confirm a transaction.

    /// Create a simple auction with `_biddingTime`
    /// seconds bidding time on behalf of the
    /// beneficiary address `_beneficiary`.
    function SimpleAuction(uint _biddingTime,
                           address _beneficiary) {
        beneficiary = _beneficiary;
        auctionStart = now;
        biddingTime = _biddingTime;
    }

    /// Bid on the auction with the value sent
    /// together with this transaction.
    /// The value will only be refunded if the
    /// auction is not won.
    function bid() {
        // No arguments are necessary, all
        // information is already part of
        // the transaction.
        if (now > auctionStart + biddingTime)
            // Revert the call if the bidding
            // period is over.
            throw;
        if (msg.value <= highestBid)
            // If the bid is not higher, send the
            // money back.
            throw;
        if (highestBidder != 0)
            highestBidder.send(highestBid);
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
        HighestBidIncreased(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }

    /// End the auction and send the highest bid
    /// to the beneficiary.
    function auctionEnd() {
        if (now <= auctionStart + biddingTime)
            throw; // auction did not yet end
        if (ended)
            throw; // this function has already been called
        AuctionEnded(highestBidder, highestBid);
        // We send all the money we have, because some
        // of the refunds might have failed.
        beneficiary.send(this.balance);
        ended = true;
    }

    function () {
        // This function gets executed if a
        // transaction with invalid data is sent to
        // the contract or just ether without data.
        // We revert the send so that no-one
        // accidentally loses money when using the
        // contract.
        throw;
    }

## Blind Auction

The previous open auction is extended to a blind auction
in the following. The advantage of a blind auction is
that there is no time pressure towards the end of
the bidding period. Creating a blind auction on a
transparent computing platform might sound like a
contradiction, but cryptography comes to the rescue.

During the **bidding period**, a bidder does not
actually send her bid, but only a hashed version of it.
Since it is currently considered practically impossible
to find two (sufficiently long) values whose hash
values are equal, the bidder commits to the bid by that.
After the end of the bidding period, the bidders have
to reveal their bids: They send their values
unencrypted and the contract checks that the hash value
is the same as the one provided during the bidding period.

Another challenge is how to make the auction
**binding and blind** at the same time: The only way to
prevent the bidder from just not sending the money
after he won the auction is to make her send it
together with the bid. Since value transfers cannot
be blinded in Ethereum, anyone can see the value.

The following contract solves this problem by
accepting any value that is at least as large as
the bid. Since this can of course only be checked during
the reveal phase, some bids might be **invalid**, and
this is on purpose (it even provides an explicit
flag to place invalid bids with high value transfers):
Bidders can confuse competition by placing several
high or low invalid bids.
