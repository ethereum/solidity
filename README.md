## Useful links
To get started you can find an introduction to the language in the [Solidity documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.org). In the documentation, you can find [code examples](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html) as well as [a reference](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solidity-in-depth.html) of the syntax and details on how to write smart contracts.

You can start using [Solidity in your browser](https://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity/) with no need to download or compile anything.
